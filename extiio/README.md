LICENCING
*********

I do not believe in licences: they hold no meaning to me.  I do not
like them either: they are boilerplate noise added at the beginning
of otherwise perfectly clean files.  If, for whatever reason, you
need a licenced version of this software, ask me which kind of
licence do you want, and I will stick it to the code and send you the
resulting dirty files.
